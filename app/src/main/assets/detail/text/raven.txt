Raven

A raven is any of several larger-bodied bird species of the genus Corvus. These species do not form a single taxonomic group within the genus. There is no consistent distinction between "crows" and "ravens", and these appellations have been assigned to different species chiefly on the basis of their size.[citation needed]
The largest raven species are the common raven and the thick-billed raven.
Etymology
The term ‘raven’ originally referred to the common raven (Corvus corax), the type species of the genus Corvus, which has a larger distribution than any other species of Corvus, ranging over much of the Northern Hemisphere.
The modern English word raven has cognates in all other Germanic languages, including Old Norse (and subsequently modern Icelandic) hrafn[1] and Old High German (h)raban,[2] all of which descend from Proto-Germanic *hrabanaz.[3]
Collective nouns for a group of ravens (or at least the common raven) include ‘rave’,[4] ‘treachery’,[5] ‘unkindness’[6] and ‘conspiracy’.[7] In practice most people use the more generic ‘flock’.[8]
